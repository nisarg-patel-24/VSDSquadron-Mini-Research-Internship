# VSDSquadron Mini Research Internship
###   Task 4 ---> Project Description
## Project : 4-bit SERIAL IN PARALLEL OUT [SIPO] Shift Register
#### INTRODUCTION:
* In the realm of digital electronics, serial-in parallel-out (SIPO) shift registers play a pivotal role in various applications, offering efficient data transfer and storage capabilities. These registers form a fundamental component in digital systems, facilitating the conversion of serial data streams into parallel data outputs.<br/>
* The essence of SIPO shift registers lies in their ability to receive data serially, bit by bit, and then distribute this data in parallel fashion across multiple output lines simultaneously. This process enables the expansion of available output ports, effectively increasing the capacity for data transmission and manipulation within a digital circuit.<br/>
#### REQUIRED COMPONENTS:
* VSD SQUADRON MINI BOARD
* IC 74HC595 [shift register]
* LED x8
* RESISTORS [220 OHM]x8
* CAPACITOR [10uF or greater value]
* JUMPER WIRES
* POWER SUPPLY
* BREAD BOARD
